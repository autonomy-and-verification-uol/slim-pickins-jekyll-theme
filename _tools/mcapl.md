The Model Checking Agent Programming Language (MCAPL) framework is a suite of tools for building interpreters for agent programming languages and  model checking programs executing in those interpreters.  It consists of the AIL toolkit for building interpreters for rational agent programming languages (BDI languages) and the Agent Java PathFinder (AJPF) model checker. AJPF extends the JavaPathfinder model checker to prove Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) properties of BDI agents.  This distribution also contains a number of programming languages implemented in the AIL.  Chief among these are Gwendolen, the EASS variant of Gwendolen that can be used to program hybrid autonomous systems and GOAL.
