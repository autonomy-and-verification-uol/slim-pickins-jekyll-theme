## Workshop

This workshop brings together people who are interested in the verification and regulation challenges when using robotic systems for remote inspection.

The workshop is divided into three sessions covering: Applications, Regulation and Verification, and Future Challenges.  Each session will have talks and a Q&A session, to further dig into the details of the regulation and verification challenges. We have a variety of speakers, from industry, regulation organisations, and academia.

## Registration

Registration for the workshop is *free* and available via our [eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/verification-and-regulatory-issues-for-remote-robotic-inspection-tickets-130767654575)

## Draft Programme

* 09:00: **Introduction**  -- [Michael Fisher](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~michael) (University of [Manchester]({{site.UoM_URL}}), [RAIN Hub]({{ site.RAIN_HUB_URL }}), [ORCA Hub]({{site.ORCA_HUB_URL}}))

* 09:10--11:10: **Session 1: APPLICATIONS**   
Session Chair: [Matt Webster](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/school-of-computer-science-and-mathematics/matt-webster) ([Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/school-of-computer-science-and-mathematics) and [ORCA Hub]({{site.ORCA_HUB_URL}}))

  - [Nick Hawes](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/) (University of Oxford, [RAIN Hub]({{ site.RAIN_HUB_URL }})): Remote inspection of nuclear assets
  - Frank van Bockel (Head of New Product Development, Business Assurance & Inspection Services, Lloyds Register Group): Remote inspection and survey in industry and maritime sectors
  - [Rob Richardson](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering/staff/173/professor-robert-richardson) (University of Leeds, [UK-RAS](https://www.ukras.org/)): Remote urban inspection
  - [Kris Kydd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-kydd-meng-ceng-miet-3a205942) (Robotics Lead, Total E&P UK Limited): Remote inspection of Oil&Gas facilities

  - Q&A:
    - What do you see as the future for remote inspection?
    - What is the biggest barrier to this?
    - Is this barrier technical or regulatory?

* 11:10--11:30: **Break**

* 11:30--13:30: **Session 2: REGULATION and VERIFICATION**  
Session chair: [Youcef Gheraibia](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/youcef-gheraibia(4ef9b33f-1555-4612-8e7b-c0f72be0fb0f).html) ([University of York]({{site.UoY_URL}}) and [AAIP]({{site.AA_URL}}))

  - Mark Tipping  (Offshore Technology Manager, [Lloyds Register Group](https://www.lr.org/en/)): Regulation and verification in offshore Oil&Gas and wind
  - Andrew White [ONR, RAIN]: Context: Nuclear Regulation
  - Hamish MacDonald, (Engineer, [Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult](https://ore.catapult.org.uk/)): Testing of inspection robotics in offshore wind
  - [Matt Webster](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/school-of-computer-science-and-mathematics/matt-webster) ([Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/school-of-computer-science-and-mathematics) and [ORCA Hub]({{site.ORCA_HUB_URL}})): Simulation-based Testing (inspection of offshore assets)

  - Q&A:
    - Are current approaches sufficient for remote inspection?
    - If not, what steps do we need to take?
    - And who needs to take them? Academia? Industry? Regulators?
    - Why is there no cross-sector approach - what is so different in each area?

* 13:30--14:00: **Break**

* 14:00--16:00: **Session 3: FUTURE and CHALLENGES**  
Session chair: [Matt Luckcuck](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/matthew.luckcuck.html) (University of [Manchester]({{site.UoM_URL}}) and [RAIN Hub]({{ site.RAIN_HUB_URL }}))

  * TBC ([Sellafield](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/sellafield-ltd))  : Future Nuclear Opportunities
  - [John McDermid](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/jam) ([University of York]({{site.UoY_URL}}) and [AAIP]({{site.AA_URL}})): Assurance, Cross-sectorial issues
  * TBC ([Oil and Gas Authority](https://www.ogauthority.co.uk)) : Offshore Opportunities
  - [Michael Fisher](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~michael) (University of [Manchester]({{site.UoM_URL}}), [RAIN Hub]({{ site.RAIN_HUB_URL }}), [ORCA Hub]({{site.ORCA_HUB_URL}})) : Problems with Autonomy (and Regulation/Verification)

  - Q&A:
    - What are the strongest opportunities?
    - What are the barriers? Are they technological or regulatory?
    - Where will we be in 10 years time?
