## Workshop

Robots and autonomous systems are increasingly used for remote inspection of various installations, from offshore wind farms to nuclear decommissioning sites, industrial plants, and disaster areas. Such systems are particularly useful for [dull, dirty, dangerous, dear](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/16/the-4-ds-of-robotization-dull-dirty-dangerous-and-dear/), delicate, and difficult (6D) scenarios, and are frequently safety- and mission-critical. Consequentially, verification and regulation are essential to ensure safe and reliable operations.

This workshop brings together key stakeholders interested in the verification and regulation challenges faced when using robotic systems for remote inspection. The workshop is divided into three sessions covering: Applications, Regulation and Verification, and Future Challenges. Each session will have talks and a Q&A session, to further explore the details of the regulation and verification challenges. A variety of speakers, from industry, regulatory organisations, and academia, will present the latest developments from their fields.

## Registration

Registration for the workshop is *free* and available via our [eventbrite page](https://vandr4ri.eventbrite.co.uk)

  - Frank van Bockel (Head of New Product Development, Business Assurance & Inspection Services, [Lloyds Register Group](https://www.lr.org/en/)): Remote inspection and survey in industry and maritime sectors
  - [Rob Richardson](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering/staff/173/professor-robert-richardson) (University of Leeds, [UK-RAS](https://www.ukras.org/)): Remote urban inspection
  - [Kris Kydd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-kydd-meng-ceng-miet-3a205942) (Robotics Lead, Total E&P UK Limited): Remote inspection of Oil&Gas facilities

  - Q&A:
    - What do you see as the future for remote inspection?
    - What is the biggest barrier to this?
    - Is this barrier technical or regulatory?

* 11:10--11:30: **Break**

* 11:30--13:30: **Session 2: REGULATION and VERIFICATION**  
Session chair: [Youcef Gheraibia](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/youcef-gheraibia(4ef9b33f-1555-4612-8e7b-c0f72be0fb0f).html) ([University of York]({{site.UoY_URL}}) and [AAIP]({{site.AA_URL}}))

  - Mark Tipping  (Offshore Technology Manager, [Lloyds Register Group](https://www.lr.org/en/)): Regulation and verification in offshore Oil&Gas and wind
  - Andrew White ([Office for Nuclear Regulation](http://www.onr.org.uk/)): Nuclear Regulation
  - Hamish MacDonald, (Engineer, [Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult](https://ore.catapult.org.uk/)): Testing of inspection robotics in offshore wind
  - [Matt Webster](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/school-of-computer-science-and-mathematics/matt-webster) ([Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/school-of-computer-science-and-mathematics) and [ORCA Hub]({{site.ORCA_HUB_URL}})): Simulation-based Testing (inspection of offshore assets)

  - Q&A:
    - Are current approaches sufficient for remote inspection?
    - If not, what steps do we need to take?
    - And who needs to take them? Academia? Industry? Regulators?
   

* 13:30--14:00: **Break**

* 14:00--16:00: **Session 3: FUTURE and CHALLENGES**  
Session chair: [Matt Luckcuck](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/matthew.luckcuck.html) (University of [Manchester]({{site.UoM_URL}}) and [RAIN Hub]({{site.RAIN_HUB_URL}}))

  * Dave MacKinnon [Technology Leadership Board](http://www.the-tlb.com/Working-at-the-TLB.html) : Offshore Opportunities
  - [Michael Fisher](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~michael) (University of [Manchester]({{site.UoM_URL}}), [RAIN Hub]({{site.RAIN_HUB_URL}}), [ORCA Hub]({{site.ORCA_HUB_URL}})): Problems with Autonomy (and Regulation/Verification)

  - Q&A:
    - What are the strongest opportunities?
    - What are the barriers? Are they technological or regulatory?
    - Why is there no cross-sector approach - what is so different in each area?
    - Where will we be in 10 years time?
