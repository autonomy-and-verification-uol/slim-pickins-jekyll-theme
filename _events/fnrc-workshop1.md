## Workshop

This workshop introduced the current nuclear certification process, highlighted some of the challenges as we move towards more sophisticated Robotics and AI solutions, and discussed the way forward. It was held on the **11th of September 2018** in **Manchester**.

We had presentations (available below) from representatives by the Universities of [Liverpool]({{site.UoL_URL}}) and [York]({{site.UoY_URL}}), and the [Office for Nuclear Regulation]({{site.ONR_URL}}) (ONR). The workshop was well attended, with attendees from both academia and industry who had an interest in robotics, autonomy, AI, safety, assurance, and certification. Specifically we had attendees who are involved in the [RAIN Hub]({{ site.RAIN_HUB_URL }}), [Assuring Autonomy]({{site.AA_URL}}) programme, and the [Office for Nuclear Regulation]({{site.ONR_URL}}). In the afternoon, we had a lively discussion session about safety cases and robotics in the nuclear industry, trying to elicit the scenarios and requirements of such systems.
