Cyber security is a key concern within most complex, communicating systems particularly cyber-physical systems that may involve robotics, autonomy, and/or machine-learning. Currently these kinds of systems are under-represented in space deployments. However, recent advancements in the development of such systems indicates that future space missions will inevitably deploy robotics, autonomy, and machine-learning in a much more fundamental way. Due to the communicating nature of these systems, cyber security considerations should play a central role in the design and development of future space research and missions.

We will bring leading companies tackling the development of future space technologies together with academic experts from the FAIR-SPACE Hub to discuss security in order to scope out research priorities and to develop collaborative R&D programmes on the topic of cyber security between FAIR-SPACE and industrial partners.
