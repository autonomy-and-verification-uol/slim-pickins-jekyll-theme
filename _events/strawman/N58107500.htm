<p>[NB. No account has been taken of other activities or ageing processes which could add to the total frequency of demand on the safety function. In a 'real' safety case this should be done.]</p>
<p>The&nbsp;conservative consequence of an accident&nbsp;from either&nbsp;hazard (collision or splash)&nbsp;progressing to an accident is 0 mSv for the general public and &lt;2 mSv for a local on-site worker. Assuming that the liquor is only from the top 5 cm of the surface of the pond.</p>
<p>The general public would be entirely unaffected because the hazards would involve relatively small volumes of pond liquor which, in the case of the liquor is contained by a pond bund.</p>
<p>The unmitigated failure rate of the robot has been shown to be &lt;2 pdfy for each of the 2 hazards&nbsp;(<a class="ASCE-Embedded" href="N83710352.htm" subnodeid="" nodeid="N83710352">A1.4.3.3.4.4.3.1.2.1 - Analysis indicates that the failure rate is acceptable</a>) (i.e.&nbsp;total&nbsp;4 pdfy) and it is argued that this is acceptable (blue circle in the diagram below)</p>
<p>SIL4 components (switches and relays) have been used in&nbsp;a 1oo4 architecture.</p>
<p>The diverse, independent and partially segregated SIF has a failure rate of 1E-4 pfd.</p>
<p>NB. This SIF failure rate is considered to be difficult to attain; even with SIL 4 components and a 1oo4 architecture. Therefore, a challenge could be mitigated with an additional SIF constructed from a (analogue)&nbsp;sonar sensor formed to be short range and only in the direction of motion. On detecting an obstacle in its path the propeller power would be cut.</p>
<p>Consequently, the residual likelihood of the hazard progressing to an accident is 4E-4 pdfy (green circle in the diagram below)</p>
