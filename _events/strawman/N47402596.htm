<p>The SIF comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors ((Complex) Collision Sensor and Image Classifier)</li>
<li>Decision making (symbolic AI)</li>
<li>Conventional Controller (including hardware platform)</li>
<li>Actuators (propeller motors)</li>
<li>Runtime monitors and WDT</li>
</ul>
<p><u>SFC</u></p>
<p>ONR SAP EDR.4 (Single failure criterion): not applicable as the robot will only be deployed below the BSL</p>
<p><u>Sensors</u></p>
<p>No claim is made&nbsp;for the Image Classifier.</p>
<p>The (Complex) Collision Sensor is <strong>diverse</strong> from the Image Classifier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented in different processors and support devices</li>
<li>The PCBs were designed, routed and manufactured by different people and organisations</li>
<li>The software was specified (from the SIF and system level requirements) by different people</li>
<li>The software lifecycle was managed and implemented (including coding and verification) by diverse teams within the same organisation.</li>
<li>The software deployed on the hardware was validated by the robot systems team</li>
</ul>
<p>The (Complex) Collision Sensor is&nbsp;<strong>independent</strong>&nbsp;of the Image Classifier:</p>
<ul>
<li>No intermediate or final decision made by the Image Classifier is used in the (Intelligent) Collision Sensor</li>
<li>No intermediate or final decision made by the&nbsp;(Complex) Collision Sensor is used in the Image Classifier (although no claim is made for this)</li>
</ul>
<p>The (Complex) Collision Sensor is&nbsp;partially <strong>segregated</strong> from&nbsp;the Image Classifier:</p>
<ul>
<li>They&nbsp;operate from a common power source, however, have separate power conditioning ensuring that a failure of the Image Classifier cannot effect the (Intelligent) Collision Sensor</li>
<li>They are placed in separate metal compartments within the robot</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Decision making</u></p>
<p>There&nbsp;are no <strong>diverse</strong> means of decision making in this robot. Reliance is placed on the ability of the formal verification methods to provide enough of a claim.</p>
<p>The decision making part of the SIF is&nbsp;part of the overall control system SIS of which the decision making SSC is an element. It is therefore, not <strong>independent</strong> of the of other SIFs or the overall control system SIS. Reliance is placed on the ability of the formal verification methods to provide enough of a claim.</p>
<p>The decision making is not <strong>independent</strong> of the Image Classifier (which has no claim made from it). However, the logic in the decision making is such that the (Complex) Collision Sensor input (along with a timer) is capable of overriding any input from the Image Classifier. Reliance is placed on the ability of the formal verification methods to provide enough of a claim.</p>
<p>The decision making is in the same compartment as the (Complex) Collision Sensor and therefore is segregated from the Image Classifier. The Image Classifier outputs are electrically isolated from the inputs of the decision making by opto-isolation. The decision making operates from the same power source and power conditioning as the (Intelligent) Collision Sensor. Therefore, it is suitably <strong>segregated</strong> from the Image Classifier.</p>
<p><u>Conventional Control Algorithms</u></p>
<p>There are no <strong>diverse</strong> means of providing Conventional Control Algorithm control to the actuators.</p>
<p>The Conventional Controller part of the SIF is&nbsp;part of the overall control system of which the&nbsp;Conventional Controller&nbsp;SSC is an element. It is therefore, not <strong>independent</strong> of the of other SIFs or the overall control system SIS. Reliance is placed on the ability implement the Conventional Controller and hardware platform to&nbsp;provide enough of a claim.</p>
<p>The Conventional Controller only take input from the decision making SSC and therefore is not (indirectly) <strong>independent</strong> of the Image Classifier. However, the logic in the decision making is such that the (Complex) Collision Sensor input (along with a timer) is capable of overriding any input from the Image Classifier. Reliance is placed on the ability of the formal verification methods to provide enough of a claim.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Conventional Controller is in the same compartment as the (Complex) Collision Sensor and therefore is segregated from the Image Classifier. The Image Classifier has no electrical interface to the Conventional Controller. The Conventional Controller operates from the same power source and power conditioning as the (Intelligent) Collision Sensor. Therefore, it is suitably <strong>segregated</strong> from the Image Classifier.</p>
<p><u>Actuators (Propeller motors)</u></p>
<p>The ultimate safe state for the actuators is to remove power. Therefore, it is unnecessary for there to be a <strong>diverse</strong> or <strong>independent</strong> actuation.</p>
<p>The Actuators are in a separate metal compartment to the rest of the SIF thereby providing EMC, and heat <strong>segregation</strong>. The Actuators operates on the same power source as the rest of the SIF, however, it has its own power conditioning. This make the rest of the SIF less vulnerable to power fluctuations caused by the actuators.</p>
<p><u>Runtime monitors and WDT</u></p>
<p>The Runtime monitors protect the operation of the decision making.</p>
<p>The Runtime monitors&nbsp;are <strong>diverse</strong> from the decision making:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented in different processors and support devices</li>
<li>The PCBs were designed, routed and manufactured by different people and organisations</li>
<li>The software was specified (from the SIF and system level requirements) by different people</li>
<li>The software lifecycle was managed and implemented (including coding and verification) by diverse teams within the same organisation.</li>
<li>The software deployed on the hardware was validated by the robot systems team</li>
</ul>
<p>The Runtime monitors&nbsp;are not&nbsp;<strong>diverse</strong> from the Sensors. i.e. they take input from the sensors.</p>
<p>The Runtime monitors&nbsp;are <strong>independent</strong>&nbsp;of the decision making in that they decide whether the decisions that are being made are within health, environmental and operating envelopes.</p>
<p>The Runtime monitors&nbsp;are&nbsp;partially <strong>segregated</strong> from&nbsp;the rest of the SIF:</p>
<ul>
<li>They&nbsp;operate from a common power source, however, have separate power conditioning ensuring that a failure of the&nbsp;the rest of the SIF's cannot effect the Runtime monitors</li>
<li>They are placed in separate metal compartments within the robot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The WDTs are diverse from the ...</p>
