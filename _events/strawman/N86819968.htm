<p>The Robot's overall route is pre-planned, however, in order that the camera can achieve the highest resolution possible (and from several angles) autonomy is required. It is argued in the optioneering study that the AI can achieve this better than a human can. In addition, as the actual contents of the pond is unknown, the pre-panned route may not be possible; the AI can re-route around these obstacles. Whilst the task is possible by human tele-operation, it is not optimal as the operation could take several hours and it is argued that human concentration will wane over this period.</p>
<p>In addition, the human operator can be redeployed on...</p>
