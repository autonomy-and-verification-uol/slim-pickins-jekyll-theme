<p>The following hazards have been considered for workers (on-site) and the public (off-site) and the relevant hazards identified and analysed according to RGP and high level principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Criticality</li>
<li>Direct Radiation</li>
<li>Inhalation</li>
<li>Contaminated Wound</li>
<li>Ingestion</li>
</ul>
<p>The hazards have been analysed in the context of the bow ties diagram:</p>

<p>The identified hazards&nbsp;consequence prevention&nbsp;largely lie in the Occurrence and Protection barrier regime.</p>
<p>However, a collision has the potential to cause a splash of pond liquor on to the side of the pond. It is estimated that the quantity of liquor will not exceed &lt;x&gt; mL and it&nbsp;will not exceed &lt;x&gt; mSv. A method has been established for remediation of the contaminated area which is tolerable and ALARP as it can and will be carried out by a suitably qualified and experienced person (SQEP) with appropriate PPE and common hand tools. The hand tools chosen can and will&nbsp;be decontaminated following use, the extracted material and swabs will be placed in&nbsp;medium level waste (MLW).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is estimated that the likelihood of this consequence has been reduced to tolerable and ALARP by the presence of a SIF.</p>
<p>The technical basis for the consequence assessments have been understood and endorsed by stakeholders (Hazard Identification and Analysis has been signed off by the key stakeholders).</p>
