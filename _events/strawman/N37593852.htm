<li>This safety case only addresses the safety risks from the physical presence and movement of the robot. It does NOT address any secondary safety risks associated with either the robots own or associated data collection, analysis and interpretation or that of any offline methods, procedures or tools.</li>
<li>There should be a separate safety case for commissioning</li>
<li>There should be a separate safety case for operation</li>
<li>There should be a separate safety case for recovery</li>
<li>There should be a separate safety case for maintenance.</li>
<li>There should be a separate safety case for disposal.</li>
<li>This safety case is not a complete safety case; it addresses the issues which AI brings to the&nbsp;complete robot system for this application.</li>
<li>The robot is fictitious.</li>
<li>The hazards in the application environment are known. e.g. radiation causing incorrect operation of the robot is simply another hazard.</li>
<li>The 'operation' phase includes in-environment testing.</li>
