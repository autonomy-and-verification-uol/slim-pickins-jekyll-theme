This was the website for the Autonomy and Verification Lab at the University of Liverpool.

In 2020, the lab moved to the University of Manchester. For information about the successor to the Autonomy and Verification Lab, please see the [Autonomy and Verification Group website](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/autonomy-and-verification/).

To foster collaboration between previous members of the Autonomy and Verification Lab/Group, we formed a research network that links academics in the USA, Ireland, Italy, and the UK.
