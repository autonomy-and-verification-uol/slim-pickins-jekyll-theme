The Autonomy and Verification Network is a collaborative research network that focusses on the specification, modelling, and verification of autonomous systems. The network is led by [Professor Michael Fisher](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~michael/).

The network began as the Autonomy and Verification Lab at the University of Liverpool, and in an effort to maintain our collaborations as group members left for other institutions we formed this cross-university network. The network is now distributed across several universities, including The University of Manchester, University of Nottingham, University of Aberdeen, and University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

Our work covers a variety of themes, including:
* Verifiable Architectures;
* BDI Languages and Extensions;
* Human-Robot Interaction;
* Responsibility, Ethics, and Explainability;
* Logics, Requirements Enginggering, and Specification;
* Runtime Verification;
* Standards and Policy for Autonomy.

Practical autonomous systems that the network have tackled include:
* pilotless aircraft, 
* ground rovers, 
* control systems, and
* distributed sensor systems.
