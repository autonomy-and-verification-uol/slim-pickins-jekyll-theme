<p>Requirements for the&nbsp;Collision Avoidance&nbsp;SIF&nbsp;have been derived from the system functional and non-functional safety requirements and verified.</p>
<p>NB. The requirements should include the remediation action. i.e. how to recover from the safe state.</p>
<p>The design and implementation of the Collision Avoidance&nbsp;SIF has followed a safety lifecycle model commensurate with IEC 61508. The guard has been designed and verified independently (explain what that independence is).</p>
<p>An analysis has shown that a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the maximum speed that the robot is capable of moving (this may need to be governed unless it can be shown that it is impossible to exceed the speed),</li>
<li>the mass of the robot</li>
<li>the distance between detection and collision</li>
<li>the maximum drift distance and deceleration once power is cut to the propellers</li>
</ul>
<p>results in a maximum (worst case) impact energy plus a n% margin which is less than that which the hazard analysis shows to be unsafe.</p>
<p>Probabilistic analyses&nbsp;(Failure Modes and Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA), SIL calc's and Safe Failure Fractions (SFF)) have been conducted for the SIF and shown to have a failure rate commensurate with the requirements. This analysis has also shown that a burn in of n cycles is required prior to first use.</p>
<p>The Collision Avoidance&nbsp;SIF will enter its safe state if its power or that of the (intelligent) control system fails.</p>
<p>The Collision Avoidance&nbsp;SIF sensor, actuator and their interfaces to the decision making system&nbsp;has been functionally&nbsp;tested with 100% coverage.</p>
<p>The guard has been tested to confirm it meets its non-functional requirements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance test</li>
<li>The guard has been shown to be EMC compliant (analysis and test).</li>
<li>The guard has been shown to be resilient to the environment (analysis and test).</li>
</ul>
<p>An analysis has shown that a Collision Avoidance&nbsp;SIF&nbsp;documented proof testing regime is mandated every n operating hours / before each deployment / every n years.</p>
