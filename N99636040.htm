An application level optioneering study has been performed based on a task description from which the use of an autonomous robot has been chosen for the following reasons:
<ol>
<li>The robot has the capability of surveying the pond to a depth of &lt;nnn&gt; across the whole width and length of the pond which is not possible by any other means. e.g. a camera suspended from a crane into the pond does not have the capability, on its&nbsp;own, due to sediment in the pond. The use of LIDAR, sonar and a camera with image classification enhances survey. &lt;Needs some metrics here to quantify how much better&gt;. It can identify &lt;nnn&gt; and &lt;nnn&gt; in the pond and therefore knowing this it will allow a safer remediation exercise. The additional safety is achieved by reducing the time at risk for workers around the pond during the remediation work, because they can target the most significant locations.</li>
<li>Autonomy allows the operator to leave the immediate area of the pond reducing time at risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>The disbenefits were found to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a first research deployment of the robot and therefore may not provide the data which would be necessary to facilitate the benefits described above. However, this is a mission&nbsp;enabling technology which is expected to deliver wide ranging benefits &lt;detail the benefits&gt;</li>
<li>If the robot should fail it could become radiologically contaminated waste itself.</li>
<li>The robot could collide with the pond sides and has a potential to cause an escape of pond liquor which is an additional hazard which would not exist if entering the pond directly with a crane suspended gripper. Conversely, the crane gripper could cause similar damage and without the survey will spend significantly more time retrieving spent fuel.</li>
<li>The robot could collide with the contents of the pond. This is deemed to be a minor issue as a crane suspended gripper, unaware of the location of the material in the pond, could result in similar if not worse damage.</li>
<li>The robot's propellers could splash pond liquor upto a meter outside the ponds perimeter.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, optioneering has been carried out on the designs of the SIFs and are shown to be the most appropriate solution to achieve this particular mission and also to enable the wider mission.</p>
