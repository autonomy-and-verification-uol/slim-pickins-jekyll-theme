# Autonomy and Verification Network website

## Contact and Theme

This website has been built by [Rafael Cardoso](https://rafaelcaue.github.io/) and [Matt Luckcuck](http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~mattlck/).

We are using the Jekyll theme [Slim Pickins](https://github.com/chrisanthropic/slim-pickins-jekyll-theme) as our base theme.

## Editing the Network's Website

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which compiles the files in this repository to produce a static HTML website.

The website can be edited either by cloning the repository and working locally, or directly in GitHub. Whichever method is used, _when you want to make your changes live_, make sure you **commit your changes to the master branch**. GitHub pages will automatically compile the files on the master branch, after a commit.

To reiterate this, **anything committed to the master branch will go live automatically**.

The Wiki contains various pages describing how to edit/manage the website:
