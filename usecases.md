This page lists use cases of autonomous systems that are relevant for applying verification and/or for further experiments. Please note that these use cases may not have been developed by members of the A&V network. We claim no ownership of them and offer no support, they are merely use cases that we had some experience with and thought they could be useful to other people.

- [**Mars Curiosity Rover** <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://github.com/markgatland/curiosity_mars_rover_ws)  --- a comprehensive simulation of the Mars Curiosity rover using ROS1 and Gazebo. Includes several realistic environments, as well as support for controlling the rover via Virtual Reality and a web application for interacting with the rover.
- [**Remote Inspection Rover in a Nuclear Waste Store** <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://github.com/EEEManchester/gazebo_radiation_plugin)  --- a simulation in ROS1-Gazebo of a Jackal rover performing remote inspection in a nuclear waste store; the Jackal uses a (simulated) sensor to take radiation measurements of its surroundings.
