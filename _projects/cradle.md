<!-- Engineered systems are becoming more complex and, increasingly, more autonomous; However, it has become clear that simple ethical principles, such as good/bad or right/wrong, are insufficient to capture high-level autonomous decision-making and that we need stronger concepts of "responsibility" in practice. -->

CRADLE brings together the industrial experience that <a href="https://www.jacobs.com/newsroom/press-release/jacobs-and-uk-government-fund-international-robotics-research-center">Jacobs</a> have in applied Robotics and Autonomous Systems with the research expertise at the <a href="https://www.robotics.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a> in this field, to create a collaborative research centre that is internationally leading and sustainable in the long-term.

The Centre for Robotic Autonomy in Demanding and Long-lasting Environments (CRADLE) Prosperity Partnership is funded by UKRI, the University of Manchester and Jacobs Ltd. Further details can be found on the [CRADLE website](https://cradlerobotics.co.uk/).
