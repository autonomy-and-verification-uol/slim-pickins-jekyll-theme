The Verifiable Autonomy project is an EPSRC-funded collaboration between Computer Science researchers at the University of Liverpool, Roboticists at the University of the West of England and Control Scientists at the University of Sheffield.

The project aims to tackle the challenges of robotic systems that can make their own decisions, without direct human intervention. The lab's work on this project involves extending existing program model-checking techniques for BDI-style agents, especially where this involves checking legal or ethical requirements.
