The Verifiability Node, part of the broader Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Programme, will develop novel rigorous techniques that automate the systematic and holistic verification of autonomous systems and provides a focal point for verification research in the area of autonomous systems, linking to both national and international initiatives. Our research will particularly address high-level decision-making concerning ethics, regulations, etc, through techniques across formal verification and runtime verification.
