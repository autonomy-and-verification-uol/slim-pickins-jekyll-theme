This project focuses on new advances in interconnected computing technology, to identify issues related to UK Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), from 2023 to 2040. It includes a Delphi Study and a Workshop.

The project builds on previous work with futurists forecasting the future implications of ubiquitous connectivity, artificial intelligence, mixed reality, low and no-code solutions, and digital ownership, where these challenge UK wellbeing and values. The timeframe we are considering is the next 15 years or so, specifically to 2040 and will identify specific ways in which the forecast changes may affect different aspects of the 13 CNI sectors and related national interests.

The research focusses on possible issues—technical, sociotechnical, and societal—and attempts to establish both possible Impacts and Likelihood for those issues.
