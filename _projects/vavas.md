The Verification and Validation of Autonomous Systems Network links researchers from 34 universities from across the UK who work on the verification and validation of autonomous systems. The network aims to
highlight case studies and challenges in this area of research, and to provide a roadmap for future research in this area. The network also provides a route for researchers to disseminate their work to industry, government, and the public.
